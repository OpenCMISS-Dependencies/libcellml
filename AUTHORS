Authors of the CellML DOM API:
Andrew Miller<ak.miller@auckland.ac.nz>, for the Bioengineering Institute at
the University of Auckland.

The interfaces were initially coded in IDL, based loosely on earlier interfaces
provided by Matt Halstead<matt.halstead@auckland.ac.nz>. These interfaces have
since been refined by Andrew Miller, with advice from other members of the
CellML team.

The implementation code was originally written by Andrew Miller.
